        We started our class on 7th of January last year.Even though we were from different places,I found it was nice because most of us are quite sociable endeed our staff.In the first time, most of the students didn't know how to speak english.Instead of that we had some rules that we have to follow for example <strong>language pledge</strong> which is the most important rule.<i>Language pledge</i> means each student must speak english while they were at class and at home too, so we can't use our language in every situations except Friday afternoon and for calling our family.
