        As in our program at school last year, we had a big holiday at the end of the year.I was so excited because our
        village is quite far from here so we couldn't go home during the small holiday.Then, we got 3 weeks .I thought
        it was not enough but I can say it was wonderful. How was it going?The thing which makes me really want to do
        holiday is to visit my family so when we met each other again we all were full of happiness, and even me and my
        brother were often having kind of discussion before, it was like nothing he was also happy to see me again.That
        was my last holyday and I wish that we will happiness like that over and over.

        I am from a village called Andilanatoby. It is in Ambatondrazaka district. We haven't such a big industry or
        factory but most people are farmers.However, in term of education, we are not behind we have two high school
        public and private.But the main problem in my village is the national road, it is totally broken so that brings
        an economic affects there. As I said before, most of the residents are farmers so it was so difficult for them
        to sell their local products to another region and it is a risk for the other too.It wasn't a good thing.Farmers
        sell their products in the the cheapest way and they bought end product so expensive.
