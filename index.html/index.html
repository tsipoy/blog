            After I got my bacc degree, I realized that my parents could not afford my study any more.Then, I haven't any thing to do.Fortunately, there was an advertisement on the radio to call the students who can't countinue to study which is <b>onja ngo</b>.I was so happy because I got the convocation to attend the courses but before that we had some tests so if we are able to pass the tests we can countinue.I tried as much as I can, and finally I can pass.Since then, I have studied at <b>onja</b>.
