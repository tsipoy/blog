              I am from the little village called Andilanatoby.Most of the people there are farmers.Even if it is a little village we already have high school.The big problem in my village is the  national road, it is really bad and it bring affects there. As I said before, most of the residents are farmers so some products are cheap for example rice and vegetables.But the products such as oil, sugar and petrol increase every year so that's why poverty increase too.Farmers sell their products in the the cheapest way and the bought another thig so expensive.
